\subsection{Table of Units}

Throughout this document SI (Syst\`{e}me International d'Unit\'{e}s) is employed
as the unit system.  In addition to the basic units, several derived units are
used as described below.  For each unit, the symbol is given followed by a
description of the unit and the SI name.

\section{Introduction}
Electroencephalography (EEG), which is a method to record electrical activity of the brain, has a plethora of applications such as decoding mental imageries used in brain-computer interfaces (BCI). One of the big open problems in EEG signal processing is finding a good feature space after which we can apply machine learning and classification methods to the data. The standard in the field is to start with the electrode space and then extract features such as amplitude or latencies (time domain features), frequency power spectra (frequency features), common spatial patterns (spatial features) etc. A novel approach that we would like to investigate is to first map EEG signals from electrode space into spatial coordinates of the brain to achieve more useful features.\\

These techniques are known as “source localization “ algorithms which can be applied to the signals recorded from the scalp and locate the underlying active sources generating the activity sensed on the electrodes expected to increase the signal to noise ratio. Additionally, mapping the activity from an n-channel space to fewer sources reduces data dimensionality immensely, helps avoid overfitting and redundancy, leads to better human interpretations and less computational cost with the simplification of models. Therefore, this scientific software will implement several techniques to map EEG signals from electrode space to source space.\\

In this introduction, first the purpose of the SRS document is discussed. Afterwards, the scope of requirements for the software are stated from the big picture view. Additionally, the skills and knowledge of the readers of this document are clarified. This section will end by illustrating a road map of the whole SRS document.

%  SRS.his section summarizes the skills and knowledge of the readers of the
%  SRS.Finally, 

%\plt{The introduction section is written to introduce the problem.  It starts
%  general and focuses on the problem domain. The general advice is to start with
%a paragraph or two that describes the problem, followed by a ``roadmap''
%paragraph.  A roadmap orients the reader by telling them what sub-sections to
%expect in the Introduction section.}

\subsection{Purpose of Document}
This document describes the features and behaviour of the EEGSourceLocalizer software application. It includes a variety of elements that attempts to define the intended functionality required by the customer. The purpose of the document is to provide detailed requirements of the software and to provide planning for the design stage. \\

Goals, assumptions, theoretical models, definitions, and other model derivation information are explained, allowing the reader to fully understand and verify the purpose and scientific basis of EEGSourceLocalizer. This SRS will remain abstract, describing what problem is being solved, but not how to solve it. This document will be used as a starting point for subsequent development phases, including writing the design specification and the software verification and validation plan.

%\plt{This section summarizes the purpose of the SRS document.  It does not focus
%  on the problem itself.  The problem is described in the ``Problem
%  Description'' section (Section~\ref{Sec_pd}).  The purpose is for the document
%  in the context of the project itself, not in the context of the CAS 741
%  course.  Although the ``purpose'' of the document is to get a grade in 741,
%  you should not mention this.  Instead, ``fake it'' as if this is a real
%  project.  The purpose section will be similar between projects.  The purpose
%  of the document is the purpose of the SRS, including communication, planning
%  for the design stage, etc.}

\subsection{Scope of Requirements} 

Source localization is a very general problem which can be in raised in various contexts such as telecommunication signals, brain signals etc. Also, there are numerous algorithms with different set of assumptions to solve this problem. However, the scope of this project is limited to source localization of EEG signals and it will not be applicable to other neuro imaging modalities such as magnetoencephalggram (MEG), fNIRS etc. Moreover, this software will only use 2 different algorithms of source localization: Beamforming and sLORETA and will not cover other approaches.

%\plt{Modelling the real world requires simplification.  The full complexity of
%  the actual physics, chemistry, biology is too much for existing models, and
%  for existing computational solution techniques.  Rather than say what is in
%  the scope, it is usually easier to say what is not.  You can think of it as
%  the scope is initially everything, and then it is constrained to create the
%  actual scope.  For instance, the problem can be restricted to 2 dimensions, or
%  it can ignore the effect of temperature (or pressure) on the material
%  properties, etc.}  

%\plt{The scope section is related to the assumptions section
%  (Section~\ref{sec_assumpt}).  However, the scope and the assumptions are not
%  at the same level of abstraction.  The scope is at a high level.  The focus is
%  on the ``big picture'' assumptions.  The assumptions section lists, and
%  describes, all of the assumptions.}

\subsection{Characteristics of Intended Reader} \label{sec_IntendedReader}

The intended readers are the people who will read, review and maintain the SRS.  They are the people that will conceivably design the software that is intended to meet the requirements. Therefore, they are expected to have a general understanding of EEG neuroimaging technique and EEG signal processing. Also, a very good knowledge of linear algebra and matrix manipulation is required.

%\plt{This section summarizes the skills and knowledge of the readers of the
%  SRS.  It does NOT have the same purpose as the ``User Characteristics''
%  section (Section~\ref{SecUserCharacteristics}).  The intended readers are the
%  people that will read, review and maintain the SRS.  They are the people that
%  will conceivably design the software that is intended to meet the
%  requirements.  The user, on the other hand, is the person that uses the
%  software that is built.  They may never read this SRS document.  Of course,
%  the same person could be a ``user'' and an ``intended reader.''}
%
%\plt{The intended reader characteristics should be written as unambiguously and
%  as specifically as possible.  Rather than say, the user should have an
%  understanding of physics, say what kind of physics and at what level.  For
%  instance, is high school physics adequate, or should the reader have had a
%  graduate course on advanced quantum mechanics?}

\subsection{Organization of Document}

The document follows the organizational scheme laid out by Smith \textit{et al.}
\cite{SmithAndLai2005, smith_requirements_2007}, starting with general reference
material for the reader. The introduction of the document details the purpose of
the document and intended reader, and is followed by the General System
Description. The Specific System Description reduces the problem under
consideration to a set of clearly defined definitions and models. The
Requirements section of the document clearly outlines both the Functional and
Non-functional Requirements that the software must comply with. Finally, the
document contains a list of Likely Changes to the software and Traceability
matrices and graphs.


%\plt{This section provides a roadmap of the SRS document.  It will help the
%  reader orient themselves.  It will provide direction that will help them
%  select which sections they want to read, and in what order.  This section will
%  be similar between project.}

\section{General System Description}

This section provides general information about the system.  It identifies the
interfaces between the system and its environment, describes the user
characteristics and lists the system constraints.  
%\plt{This text can likely be
%  borrowed verbatim.}
%
%\plt{The purpose of this section is to provide general information about the
%  system so the specific requirements in the next section will be easier to
%  understand. The general system description section is designed to be
%  changeable independent of changes to the functional requirements documented in
%  the specific system description. The general system description provides a
%  context for a family of related models.  The general description can stay the
%  same, while specific details are changed between family members.}

\subsection{System Context}


Figure 1 shows the system context which is an abstract view of the software. A circle represents an external entity outside the software, the user in this case. A rectangle represents the software system itself (EEGSourceLocalizer). Arrows are used to show the data flow between the system and its environment including the main inputs and outputs. The responsibilities of the user and the system are as follows:

%\plt{Your system context will include a figure that shows the abstract view of
%  the software.  Often in a scientific context, the program can be viewed
%  abstractly following the design pattern of Inputs $\rightarrow$ Calculations
%  $\rightarrow$ Outputs.  The system context will therefore often follow this
%  pattern.  The user provides inputs, the system does the calculations, and then
%  provides the outputs to the user.  The figure should not show all of the
%  inputs, just an abstract view of the main categories of inputs (like material
%  properties, geometry, etc.).  Likewise, the outputs should be presented from
%  an abstract point of view.  In some cases the diagram will show other external
%  entities, besides the user.  For instance, when the software product is a
%  library, the user will be another software program, not an actual end user.}

\begin{figure}[h!]
\begin{center}
 \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{SystemContextFigure}
\caption{System Context}
\label{Fig_SystemContext} 
\end{center}
\end{figure}

%\plt{For each of the entities in the system context diagram its responsibilities
%  should be listed.  Whenever possible the system should check for data quality,
%  but for some cases the user will need to assume that responsibility.}

\begin{itemize}
\item User Responsibilities:
\begin{itemize} 
\item  Clean and preprocess the EEG data
\item  Provide all the input data to the system (including EEG recording)
\item  Given two or more options by the system, decide to use which SL method
\end{itemize}

\item \progname{} Responsibilities:
\begin{itemize}
\item Detect data type mismatch or missing inputs
\item Calculate and plot the required outputs
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{User Characteristics} \label{SecUserCharacteristics}

The user is expected to be familiar with EEG cleaning and preprocessing to provide the software with cleaned data such as artifact removal as SL techniques are very sensitive to the data quality. Also, the user should have the knowledge about the different techniques that are provided as SL options in this software to be able to set the configurations of the methods. For this purpose, they should have an understanding of signal processing and linear algebra. Additionally, the end user is preferred to have a basic cognitive neuroscience knowledge so that they have a rough idea where the active sources during the recorded task should be expected. 

%\plt{This section summarizes the knowledge/skills expected of the user.
%  Measuring usability, which is often a required non-function requirement,
%  requires knowledge of a typical user.  As mentioned above, the user is a
%  different role from the ``intended reader,'' as given in
%  Section~\ref{sec_IntendedReader}.  As in Section~\ref{sec_IntendedReader}, the
%  user characteristics should be specific an unambiguous.  For instance, ``The
%  end user of \progname{} should have an understanding of undergraduate Level 1
%  Calculus and Physics.''}

\subsection{System Constraints}

There is no system constraints for this project.


%\plt{System constraints differ from other type of requirements because they
%  limit the developers’ options in the system design and they identify how the
%  eventual system must fit into the world. This is the only place in the SRS
%  where design decisions can be specified.  That is, the quality requirement for
%  abstraction is relaxed here.  However, system constraints should only be
%  included if they are truly required. In the context of CAS 741, you often will
%  may not have any system constraints.}

\section{Specific System Description}

This section first presents the problem description, which gives a high-level
view of the problem to be solved.  This is followed by the solution characteristics
specification, which presents the assumptions, theories, definitions and finally
the instance models.  
%\plt{Add any project specific details that are relevant
%  for the section overview.}

\subsection{Problem Description} \label{Sec_pd}

During rest state or while performing any physical or mental task, there are many activities occurring inside the brain which we can record a superficial effect of them sensed on the EEG electrodes. However, different parts of the brain have different functionalities and are more active while performing specific tasks.
\progname{} is intended to find the location and activity pattern of the underlying sources in the brain which are responsible for the EEG signal that we record from the scalp.
%\plt{What problem does your program solve?
%The description here should be in the problem space, not the solution space.}

\subsubsection{Terminology and  Definitions}

%\plt{This section is expressed in words, not with equations.  It provide the
%  meaning of the different words and phrases used in the domain of the problem.
%The terminology is used to introduce concepts from the world outside of the
%mathematical model  The terminology provides a real world connection to give the
%mathematical model meaning.}

This subsection provides a list of terms that are used in the subsequent
sections and their meaning, with the purpose of reducing ambiguity and making it
easier to correctly understand the requirements:

\begin{itemize} 

\item EEG : The electroencephalogram (EEG) is a recording of the electrical activity of the brain from the scalp. The recorded waveforms reflect the cortical electrical activity. Signal intensity: EEG activity is quite small, measured in microvolts.

\item MRI: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a medical imaging technique that uses a magnetic field and computer-generated radio waves to create detailed images of the organs and tissues in your body.

\item Coordinate system: in geometry, a coordinate system is a system that uses one or more numbers, or coordinates, to uniquely determine the position of the points or other geometric elements on a manifold such as Euclidean space.

\item Covariance: In probability theory and statistics, a covariance matrix is a square matrix giving the covariance between each pair of elements of a given random vector.

\item Rank: The maximum number of linearly independent vectors in a matrix is equal to the number of non-zero rows in its row echelon matrix. Therefore, to find the rank of a matrix, we simply transform the matrix to its row echelon form and count the number of non-zero rows.

\item Rank-deficient: A matrix is said to be rank-deficient if it does not have full rank. The rank deficiency of a matrix is the difference between the lesser between the number of rows and columns, and the rank.

\item Beamforming:  Beamforming or spatial filtering is a signal processing technique used in sensor arrays for directional signal transmission or reception.

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Physical System Description} \label{sec_phySystDescrip}

The purpose of this section is to clearly and unambiguously state the physical system that is to be modelled. The complete physical system consist of two main components: the head and the EEG electrodes set up on the the scalp. Each of these 2 have several elements. \\

EEG equipment consist of a number of electrodes (could be anything between 6 to 256 electrodes) placed on predefined locations. These locations could be specified by a cap or by sectioning the head. Also, head can be physically modeled with 3 tissues with different conductivity: brain, skull and scalp. \\

%\plt{The purpose of this section is to clearly and unambiguously state the
%  physical system that is to be modelled. Effective problem solving requires a
%  logical and organized approach. The statements on the physical system to be
%  studied should cover enough information to solve the problem. The physical
%  description involves element identification, where elements are defined as
%  independent and separable items of the physical system. Some example elements
%  include acceleration due to gravity, the mass of an object, and the size and
%  shape of an object. Each element should be identified and labelled, with their
%  interesting properties specified clearly. The physical description can also
%  include interactions of the elements, such as the following: i) the
%  interactions between the elements and their physical environment; ii) the
%  interactions between elements; and, iii) the initial or boundary conditions.}

The physical system of \progname{}, as shown in Figure~?,
includes the following elements:

\begin{itemize}

\item[PS1:] EEG recording electrodes
\item[PS2:] Electrical activity sensed by the electrodes (EEG signal)
\item[PS3:] Exact location of the electrodes (coordination)
\item[PS4:] Head (Scull, scalp and brain)
\item[PS5:] Head MRI
\item[PS6:] Brain electrical activity

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Goal Statements}

%\plt{The goal statements refine the ``Problem Description''
%  (Section~\ref{Sec_pd}).  A goal is a functional objective the system under
%  consideration should achieve. Goals provide criteria for sufficient
%  completeness of a requirements specification and for requirements
%  pertinence. Goals will be refined in Section “Instanced Models”
%  (Section~\ref{sec_instance}). Large and complex goals should be decomposed
%  into smaller sub-goals.  The goals are written abstractly, with a minimal
%  amount of technical language.  They should be understandable by non-domain
%  experts.}

\noindent Given the inputs the goal statements are:

\begin{itemize}

\item[GS\refstepcounter{goalnum}\thegoalnum \label{G_meaningfulLabel}:] Locate the active sources and their orientation
\item[GS\refstepcounter{goalnum}\thegoalnum \label{G_meaningfulLabel}:] Estimate the sources activity time course (time series)
\item[GS\refstepcounter{goalnum}\thegoalnum \label{G_meaningfulLabel}:] Estimate the average source power (over time)
\item[GS\refstepcounter{goalnum}\thegoalnum \label{G_meaningfulLabel}:] Plot the sources on a sliced MRI and 3D brain model 


%\plt{One
%    sentence description of the goal.  There may be more than one.  Each Goal
%    should have a meaningful label.}
%    
    

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Solution Characteristics Specification}

%\plt{This section specifies the information in the solution domain of the system
%  to be developed. This section is intended to express what is required in
%  such a way that analysts and stakeholders get a clear picture, and the
%  latter will accept it. The purpose of this section is to reduce the problem
%  into one expressed in mathematical terms. Mathematical expertise is used to
%  extract the essentials from the underlying physical description of the
%  problem, and to collect and substantiate all physical data pertinent to the
%  problem.}
%
%\plt{This section presents the solution characteristics by successively refining
%  models.  It starts with the abstract/general Theoretical Models (TMs) and
%  refines them to the concrete/specific Instance Models (IMs).  If necessary
%  there are intermediate refinements to General Definitions (GDs).  All of these
%  refinements can potentially use Assumptions (A) and Data Definitions (DD).
%  TMs are refined to create new models, that are called GMs or IMs. DDs are not
%  refined; they are just used. GDs and IMs are derived, or refined, from other
%  models. DDs are not derived; they are just given. TMs are also just given, but
%  they are refined, not used.  If a potential DD includes a derivation, then
%  that means it is refining other models, which would make it a GD or an IM.}
%
%\plt{The above makes a distinction between ``refined'' and ``used.'' A model is
%  refined to another model if it is changed by the refinement. When we change a
%  general 3D equation to a 2D equation, we are making a refinement, by applying
%  the assumption that the third dimension does not matter. If we use a
%  definition, like the definition of density, we aren't refining, or changing
%  that definition, we are just using it.}
%
%\plt{The same information can be a TM in one problem and a DD in another.  It is
%  about how the information is used.  In one problem the definition of
%  acceleration can be a TM, in another it would be a DD.}
%

\subsubsection{Assumptions} \label{sec_assumpt}

%\plt{The assumptions are a refinement of the scope.  The scope is general, where
%  the assumptions are specific.  All assumptions should be listed, even those
%  that domain experts know so well that they are rarely (if ever) written down.}
%\plt{The document should not take for granted that the reader knows which
%  assumptions have been made. In the case of unusual assumptions, it is
%  recommended that the documentation either include, or point to, an explanation
%  and justification for the assumption.}

This section simplifies the original problem and helps in developing the
theoretical model by filling in the missing information for the physical
system. The numbers given in the square brackets refer to the theoretical model
[T], general definition [GD], data definition [DD], instance model [IM], or
likely change [LC], in which the respective assumption is used.

\begin{itemize}

\item[A\refstepcounter{assumpnum}\theassumpnum \label{A_meaningfulLabel}:]
Each source contributes to all the channels 
\item[A\refstepcounter{assumpnum}\theassumpnum \label{A_meaningfulLabel}:] Each source have different visibility on each channel (defines the contribution of each source at each channel) 
\item[A\refstepcounter{assumpnum}\theassumpnum \label{A_meaningfulLabel}:] The activity on each channel is the linear combination of all source activities (we base our source modeling on this) 
\item[A\refstepcounter{assumpnum}\theassumpnum \label{A_meaningfulLabel}:]Sufficient length of stationary data (only related to the function of interest) to get a good estimate of covariance matrix 

%  \plt{Short description of each assumption.  Each assumption
%    should have a meaningful label.  Use cross-references to identify the
%    appropriate traceability to T, GD, DD etc., using commands like dref, ddref
%    etc.  Each assumption should be atomic - that is, there should not be an
%    explicit (or implicit) ``and'' in the text of an assumption.}

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Theoretical Models}\label{sec_theoretical}

%\plt{Theoretical models are sets of abstract mathematical equations or axioms
%  for solving the problem described in Section ``Physical System Description''
%  (Section~\ref{sec_phySystDescrip}). Examples of theoretical models are
%  physical laws, constitutive equations, relevant conversion factors, etc.}

This section focuses on the general equations and laws that \progname{} is based on. Theoretical models are sets of abstract mathematical equations or axioms for solving the problem described in Section ``Physical System Description''. The fundamental idea of source localization is divided into two main problems: one is termed a forward problem and the other is an inverse problem. The forward problem is the prediction of potential differences from the current sources inside the brain, and the estimation of the location of the sources from the measured data is termed as inverse problem.%  \plt{Modify the examples below for your problem, and add additional models
%  as appropriate.}

The magnitude and orientation of dipole are characterized by the dipole moment $d$ vector, which is pointing from the source to the sink in the figure. Hence, the magnitude of the dipole is $|d|= \mathbf{I} p$, where $p$ is the distance between the positive and negative poles, respectively. $n'$ is the unit vector defining the direction from the source to the $d$ sink. However, in the Cartesian coordinate system, the dipole can be represented by $x ,y, z$ unit vectors.\\

The medium is linear so the potential at the scalp is the superposition of the potentials from many active neurons. Suppose $x$ is composed of the potentials due to $L$ active dipole sources at locations $\mathbf q_i$ and noise.\\

Mathematically, the EEG inverse problem is typically an optimization problem. The EEG inverse problem is an ill-posed optimization problem as unknown (sources) outnumbers the known (sensors).

  Description & 
                Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a medical imaging technique used in radiology to form pictures of the anatomy and the physiological processes of the body. MRI uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to create detailed images of the organs and tissues within the body. We need these images to extract the head shape of the subject in order to model their head as precise as possible. An MRI file contains several 2D images of the head, assigning a shade of grey (0-255) depending on the tissue. Also the resolution ($res$) of this imaging depends on the device.

\subsubsection{Input Data Constraints} \label{sec_DataConstraints}    

Table~\ref{TblInputVar} shows the data constraints on the input output
variables.  The column for physical constraints gives the physical limitations
on the range of values that can be taken by the variable.  The column for
software constraints restricts the range of inputs to reasonable values.  The
software constraints will be helpful in the design stage for picking suitable
algorithms.  The constraints are conservative, to give the user of the model the
flexibility to experiment with unusual situations.  The column of typical values
is intended to provide a feel for a common scenario.  The uncertainty column
provides an estimate of the confidence with which the physical quantities can be
measured.  This information would be part of the input if one were performing an
uncertainty quantification exercise.

The specification parameters in Table~\ref{TblInputVar} are listed in
Table~\ref{TblSpecParams}.

\section{Requirements}

%\plt{The requirements refine the goal statement.  They will make heavy use of
%  references to the instance models.}

This section provides the functional requirements, the business tasks that the
software is expected to complete, and the nonfunctional requirements, the
qualities that the software is expected to exhibit.

\subsection{Functional Requirements}

\noindent \begin{itemize}

\item[R\refstepcounter{reqnum}\thereqnum \label{R_Inputs}:]  \progname shall verify that the input data are valid. Frequency component of the EEG data should be checked to see if the data is band-pass filtered. Also, \progname should ask the user to confirm if the artifact removal has been done. An error message shall be displayed if input data are invalid.
%\plt{Requirements
%    for the inputs that are supplied by the user.  This information has to be
%    explicit.}
\item[R\refstepcounter{reqnum}\thereqnum \label{R_Inputs}:]  \progname shall verify that the covariance matrix of the input data is not rank-deficient.  An error message shall be displayed if input data is invalid.

\item[R\refstepcounter{reqnum}\thereqnum \label{R_OutputInputs}:] A topographical plot of the electrode signals (EEG) would be output in addition to power plot for confirmation. 
%\plt{It isn't
%    always required, but often echoing the inputs as part of the output is a
%    good idea.}

\item[R\refstepcounter{reqnum}\thereqnum \label{R_Calculate}:] \progname shall provide correct calculate according to Instance Models according to the user’s choice of which method to use.
%\plt{Calculation
%    related requirements.}

%\item[R\refstepcounter{reqnum}\thereqnum \label{R_VerifyOutput}:]
%  \plt{Verification related requirements.}

\item[R\refstepcounter{reqnum}\thereqnum \label{R_Output}:] \progname shall plot the sources on a sliced MRI (and shall guarantee that the output file is the same pixel size as the input file) and 3D brain model.
%\plt{Output related
%    requirements.}

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Nonfunctional Requirements}

%\plt{List your nonfunctional requirements.  You may consider using a fit
%  criterion to make them verifiable.}

\noindent \begin{itemize}

\item[R\refstepcounter{reqnum}\thereqnum \label{R_Output}:] \progname shall be easy to be checked or tested.

\item[R\refstepcounter{reqnum}\thereqnum \label{R_Output}:] \progname will not crash when a user provides invalid input.

\item[R\refstepcounter{reqnum}\thereqnum \label{R_Output}:] \progname shall be easy and satisfying for users to learn and use.

\item[R\refstepcounter{reqnum}\thereqnum \label{R_Output}:] \progname shall be able to run on Windows 10, macOS 10.14, and Ubuntu Linux 18.04. environments.

\end{itemize}

\section{Likely Changes}    

\noindent \begin{itemize}

\item[LC\refstepcounter{lcnum}\thelcnum\label{LC_meaningfulLabel}:] The algorithms used to solve the inverse problem might change. Currently LCMV and sLORETA are going to be implemented. However, we might modify this.

\item[LC\refstepcounter{lcnum}\thelcnum\label{LC_meaningfulLabel}:] The option of plotting the source activity in a 3D format might be added.

%\plt{Give the likely changes, with a reference to the related assumption (aref), as appropriate.}

\end{itemize}

\section{Unlikely Changes}    

\noindent \begin{itemize}

\section{Traceability Matrices and Graphs}

The purpose of the traceability matrices is to provide easy references on what
has to be additionally modified if a certain component is changed.  Every time a
component is changed, the items in the column of that component that are marked
with an ``X'' may have to be modified as well.  Table~\ref{Table:trace} shows the
dependencies of theoretical models, general definitions, data definitions, and
instance models with each other. Table~\ref{Table:R_trace} shows the
dependencies of instance models, requirements, and data constraints on each
other. Table~\ref{Table:A_trace} shows the dependencies of theoretical models,
general definitions, data definitions, instance models, and likely changes on
the assumptions.

\plt{You will have to modify these tables for your problem.}

\plt{The traceability matrix is challenging to maintain manually.  Please do
  your best.  In the future tools (like Drasil) will make this much easier.}

The purpose of the traceability graphs is also to provide easy references on
what has to be additionally modified if a certain component is changed.  The
arrows in the graphs represent dependencies. The component at the tail of an
arrow is depended on by the component at the head of that arrow. Therefore, if a
component is changed, the components that it points to should also be
changed. Figure~\ref{Fig_ATrace} shows the dependencies of theoretical models,
general definitions, data definitions, instance models, likely changes, and
assumptions on each other. Figure~\ref{Fig_RTrace} shows the dependencies of
instance models, requirements, and data constraints on each other.

\noindent \plt{Grammar, flow and \LaTeX advice:
\begin{itemize}
\item For Mac users \texttt{*.DS\_Store} should be in \texttt{.gitignore}
\item \LaTeX{} and formatting rules
\begin{itemize}
\item Variables are italic, everything else not, includes subscripts (link to
  document)
\begin{itemize}
\item \href{https://physics.nist.gov/cuu/pdf/typefaces.pdf}{Conventions}
\item Watch out for implied multiplication
\end{itemize}
\item Use BibTeX
\item Use cross-referencing
\end{itemize}
\item Grammar and writing rules
\begin{itemize}
\item Acronyms expanded on first usage (not just in table of acronyms)
\item ``In order to'' should be ``to''
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}}

\noindent \plt{Advice on using the template:
\begin{itemize}
\item Difference between physical and software constraints
\item Properties of a correct solution means \emph{additional} properties, not
  a restating of the requirements (may be ``not applicable'' for your problem).
  If you have a table of output constraints, then these are properties of a
  correct solution.
\item Assumptions have to be invoked somewhere
\item ``Referenced by'' implies that there is an explicit reference
\item Think of traceability matrix, list of assumption invocations and list of
  reference by fields as automatically generatable
\item If you say the format of the output (plot, table etc), then your
  requirement could be more abstract
\end{itemize}
